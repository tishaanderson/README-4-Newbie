# README-4-Newbie (Module 9 Challenge)

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. 

You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.

The task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

## Table of Contents

- [Description](#description)

## Installation

In order to install `inquirer`, please use `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` in your terminal.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

`node index.js`

***Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!***

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Test Sample

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
